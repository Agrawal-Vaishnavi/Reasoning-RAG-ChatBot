# Reasoning-RAG-ChatBot
Reasoning Enhanced RAG System - A chatbot that combines retrieval-augmented generation with chain-of-thought reasoning

## The Process Flow

    -> User submits a query

    -> System retrieves initial relevant documents

    -> Chain-of-thought reasoning is applied to understand the query better

    -> The query is refined based on this reasoning

    -> A second, more focused retrieval is performed

    -> The final answer is generated considering all context

## Key Highlights

    * Two-stage retrieval: Initial retrieval followed by reasoning-enhanced retrieval

    * Query refinement: Using reasoning to create better search queries

    * Transparent reasoning: The system can explain its thought process
